/**
 * Which activation fence this run holds, so every remote step it issues can prove it still does.
 *
 * Age only says a holder went quiet, not that it cannot act: a desktop suspended past the stale
 * window resumes believing it owns the fence a successor has since taken (Astra pass 8). Each
 * holder writes a generation token into the lock it creates, and each of its commands checks that
 * token on the host, in the same command as the step, so a superseded holder aborts instead of
 * launching, mutating state, or deleting the successor's fence and journal.
